# A tutorial on using Python through Jupyter notebooks, for beginners in *data science*.

This consists of two notebooks:
1. An introduction to Python, for people who have never used the language before.
2. A demo of using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly for interacting with a data set.  Assumes you will download and unpack the BoardGameGeek data set from Keggle.  (You need an account for it, and I cannot distribute the data).
