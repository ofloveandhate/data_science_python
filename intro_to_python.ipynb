    "\n",
    "Python is a fun language with lots of ways to interact with it.  There are some rules, for sure, but you can just sit down and start writing it in a Jupyter notebook, no compiler, no text editor, no repl.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Dani's amethyst-colored advice on learning programming\n",
    "\n",
    "* Have a goal.  Work toward it, bit by bit.  Choose a lofty goal.  Write it down.  What do you want to do?  What does your program take as input?  What does it do for output?  Ask questions of those more knowledgeable than you.  And less knowledgeable, too.  \n",
    "* Embrace your mistakes.  It's just a form of writing and communication.  Along the way, you write drafts.\n",
    "* Eat some delicious food.  Drink your favorite beverage.\n",
    "* Learn and use a version control system.  Learn the difference between Git and Github -- they're not the same thing at all.\n",
    "* Document what you do by writing comments.  This is one reason Jupyter notebooks are so great.  They have a narrative format and presentation built into the code.\n",
    "* Learn how to use the terminal.  Not all code should go into a Jupyter notebook.  Don't write library code in a notebook -- it goes in a library.  At that time, you'll learn about `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__init__` and other double-underscored things\n",
    "* Try your hand at object-oriented Python.  The types are weak with this one, so you can add new data fields willy-nilly.\n",
    "* Also learn C++, for templates and black voodoo magic.  Strong typing is an asset, not a liability, and the compiler is your ultimate arbiter, a friend who will endlessly help you write better code.  Also, lint.\n",
    "* Also learn R, Go, Rust, D, and all the other languages.  Confuse yourself by checking out [BrainFuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).\n",
    "* Content yourself with knowing your slice of the pie, recognize that there is not enough time to do everything yourself.  \n",
